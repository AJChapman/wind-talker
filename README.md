# Wind Talker Client-Side Rendering

To use, load d3.html in a web browser.
As a temporary measure during development it uses CORS Anywhere to get around browsers' CORS limitations.
To use this you will need to go to http://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo and click on the 'Request temporary access to the demo server' button.

## TODO

- Add wind direction graph
- Local storage of previously retrieved data?
- Variable window size (either fixed sizes, e.g. 1, 4, 12 hours, day, or a continuous selection up to a day)
- Logarithmic time scale? Recent values more spaced out, compressing as time passes.
